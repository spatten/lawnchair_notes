This is a simple demo of Brian Leroux's [Lawnchair][].

It does CRUD on a note model and stores the notes on your machine.  Webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) use HTML5 local database store.  All others will use Google Gears.

Most of the meat is in javascripts/notes.js.

You can also check out a [live demo][] of the app.
